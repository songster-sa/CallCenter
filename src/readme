Problem statement :
Imagine you have call center with three levels of employees : respondent, manager and director.
An incoming telephone call must be allocated first to a respondent who is free.
If the respondent cant handle the call, it must be escalated to the manager.
If the manager is not free or cannot handle the call, it must be escalated to the director.
